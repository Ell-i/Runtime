/**
 * System initialisation interface.
 *
 * In the ELL-i platform the MCU system is initialised in a
 * data-driven approach, where the peripheral registers and their
 * initialisation values are described with data structures rather
 * than sequential code.  There are two reasons for this.  Firstly,
 * the resulting code is about 30-40% smaller, mainly due to the way
 * constants are handled in Thumb code.  Secondly, this leans towards
 * later implementing a domain specific language (DSL) for describing
 * peripheral use.
 *
 * The actual implementation places the main initialisation data into
 * a separate read-only linker section, @see SYSTEM_INIT_SECTION.  The
 * linker records the beginning and end of this section, similar to
 * the practise used for C++ static initialisers in traditional C++
 * runtimes.  The initialisation code in @see SystemInitPeripherals
 * iterates through the section, initialising those peripherals that
 * are used in the application.  Those that are not used are not
 * linked in to the binary, and therefore not initialised.
 *
 * If any peripherals need to be initialised in a specific order, such
 * as initialising clocks before anything else, this may be arranged
 * with linker directives in the linker script.  For the Mac OS X
 * version of the emulator, a linker order file needs to be used.
