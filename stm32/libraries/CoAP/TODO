CLEAN UP ETHERNET HEADER DEFINITION!  See ethernet.h

Move MAC address handling to the driver, add an API

Refactor the code so that it gets compiled and optimised as a large single object:

In the overall.c file, define the packet structure, similar to the test case

include all the stuff there

eth_input is a real function, called from enc28j60 code
- even it could be inlined but one function overhead is not that bad

inline ip_input, udp_input, and icmp_input

udp socket handlers are again separate functions, called through pointers

udp_output is a real function, called from CoAP

make sure ip_output is called via a tail call from udp_output and icmp
- make static and tail called, allowing optimised call passing
