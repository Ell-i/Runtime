This is a very early README; please enhance me!

Organization
============

Source directories, Arduino IDE compatible:

cores
libraries
system
variants

Building and testing directories, ELL-i specific:

build -- unclear what to do with this in the long term.  Good for now.
make
scripts
tests

Emulator, Ell-i specific:

emulator

Unclear whether is Arduino IDE compatible or not, don't remember now:

examples

Compiling
=========

Building for Ellduino board, (for now):

make -C libraries
cd build
make sketch.cpp
make

Building for Emulator, you need to set PLATFORM to emulator, there are
two ways for that:

1. Set environment variable

export PLATFORM=emulator
make -C ../libraries clean && make -C ../libraries
make clean
make

2. Use a command line variable

Use PLATFORM=emulators on all make commands
