 * With the current Arduino API, it is not possible to reliably
 * determine at compile time which PWM ports are used and which are
 * not.  Hence, the only viable option at the moment is to explicitly
 * refer to the TIMER system init records, by creating explicit
 * references to them.  With the -fdata-sections gcc options, the
 * __TIMERx names below will be deleted during link time, leaving only
 * the referenced and explicitly kept TIMERx_INIT records into the
 * linked code (due to the corresponding linker KEEP directive.)
 *
 * Another option would be to create an explicit references from the
 * code, but that is even worse since it would generate runtime code.
